        <h1>The Life of Spiderman</h1>
        <p>His real name is Peter Parker, a young man from New York City who gains spider-like abilities—such as wall-crawling, enhanced strength, agility, and a "spider-sense"—after being bitten by a radioactive spider.</p>

            <h2>Early Life and Career</h2>
                <p>Before becoming a superhero, the early life of Spider-Man's alter ego, Peter Parker, was defined by his humble upbringing as a bullied orphan and brilliant student in Queens. His life took a dramatic turn when a radioactive spider bite gave him superpowers, forcing him to confront the responsibility that comes with his new abilities. </p>

                <h2>Spiderman's First Battle</h2>
                <p>The first major villain that Spiderman battled in the live action films was the Green Goblin (Norman Osborn), after gaining superhuman abilities and becoming mentally unstable. Spider-Man’s final battle with the Green Goblin happens in an abandoned building, where they fight brutally. Green Goblin injures Spider-Man badly, but when he tries to kill him with his glider, Spider-Man dodges, and the glider impales the Green Goblin instead, killing him.</p>
